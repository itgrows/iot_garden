# This repository will soon host the software for the Gardening with Arduino project.

## After a bit of cleanup and documentation this repository will soon contain:

  * the headless (without UI) python3 client which writes commands and reads RDF data on a solid pod.
  * the Arduino software which reads CSV commands and writes RDF data on a solid pod.
